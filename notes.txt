@register of accounts
    register for admins is separated and no need for email send
    register for students & teachers need email send

@emails
    admin = jeremybreccion@gmail.com
    students & teachers = jeremybreccion@yahoo.com (as of 2018-03-02)
    //since email is not yet unique

@delete account
    currently, no prevention of deleting logged in users from other computers
    e.g. admin A should not be able to delete student B if B is logged in from another computer

@classes
    unique class names for each teacher. same class names may be shared by teachers
    no time properties. therefore no conflicts yet and no prevention of conflict in sched
